# Haoming Li
I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I received B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Chicago in 2022.

My main areas of interest are semantics, pragmatics, syntax, and their interfaces. 

Specific topics I have covered include:
- modals of permission
- free choice
- inferences of number marking
- distributivity
- universal quantifiers
- _even_
- comparatives
- Across-the-Board constructions
- *wh*-questions
- syntax of Mandarin Chinese
