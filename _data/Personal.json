  {"id":"laiMovingHeadsSpecifiers2024","abstract":"Based on a hitherto neglected set of multiple pre-subject modal sentences, this article offers a novel syntactic account of Mandarin modals whereby the derivation of pre-subject modal sentences involves Internal Merge of modals to specifiers of the left-peripheral focus projection, and discusses new problems facing a traditional head-movement analysis and the existing XP-movement accounts. Our proposal lends novel support to recent claims that “true” syntactic head movement targets specifier positions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Lai","given":"Jackie Yan-Ki"},{"family":"Li","given":"Haoming"}],"citation-key":"laiMovingHeadsSpecifiers2024","container-title":"Natural Language & Linguistic Theory","container-title-short":"Nat Lang Linguist Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s11049-023-09579-0","ISSN":"1573-0859","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"247-272","source":"Springer Link","title":"Moving heads to specifiers: Evidence from Mandarin multiple pre-subject modals","title-short":"Moving heads to specifiers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11049-023-09579-0","volume":"42"},
